# Working Uploading and Recalling Files
It is possible to upload files to a Case Key Value combination,  with these files being centrally stored in the database.

Navigate to a case record via either Fetch or Skim:

In the case upload tab there exists a file upload pane,  which will accept a dragged and dropped file,  or the specification of a file location by clicking on the Select Files button:

Use the Select Files dialogue box to navigate to, and select a file, in this case an image:

The file will be uploaded and available in the database (not the file system):

```sql
select * from "CaseFile"
```

The file list is all files rolling up to the Case Key Value combination. To reference or retrieve an uploaded file,  note firstly that the file name is a link:
