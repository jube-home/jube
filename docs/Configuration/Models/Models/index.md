# Models

Jube does not have a fixed model specification nor integration API, instead, Models are configured via the user
interface assuming the availability of JSON on integration.

The default and example models are built around the following JSON object:

```json

```

The example JSON is used extensively throughout this documentation, however naming elements aside, it is a highly
generic format. Jube can handle any correctly formed JSON, seeking to be directed to the data elements via JSONPath.
JSONPath is a query language for JSON and has the effect of allowing for the support of any existing interfaces that set
forth the POST body as JSON.

In this guide a rudimentary HTTP request tool called GetIt (https://getit.bartkessels.net/) is used. Many other HTTP
testing tools are available, such as Postman or tools within most IDE's, such as Jetbrains. For completeness, the above
example JSON would represent a POST body for HTTP invocation:

![Image](ExampleJSONInPost.png)

Invocation is explained in more depth elsewhere in the documentation, and it is suffice to draw attention to the above
to the HTTP verb as being of type POST, the JSON comprising the POST body, and the url slug
api/Invoke/EntityAnalysisModel/<Guid> (whereby the Guid is the model identifier). It follows that a Model is an endpoint
in practice.

Start by navigating to Models >> Models:

The documentation will proceed on the basis of reconstructing the default or example model, installed by Migration also.

The Entity Models screen is where a model is first defined and allocated a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) for recall.

Start by clicking on the New button to expose the basic parameters:

The parameters required for the creation of a new Model will be displayed:

The table as follows gives an introduction to each parameter:

| Value                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example                              |

| GUID                                       | When an Entity Model is created it is allocated a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) which will be the key to the model upon it being recalled via the HTTP Endpoint.  For example,  the GUID is used in recalling the model via this endpoint as: [https://localhost:5001/api/invoke/EntityAnalysisModel/90c425fd-101a-420b-91d1-cb7a24a969cc](https://localhost:5001/api/invoke/EntityAnalysisModel/90c425fd-101a-420b-91d1-cb7a24a969cc)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 90c425fd-101a-420b-91d1-cb7a24a969cc |

When retrieval is made from the Cache it is done so by selecting all records where there is a match on a search key,  hence there is the potential for denial of service events without such a constraint. The return of large amounts of data from the cache can degrade response times and affect response times in a linear fashion.  The maximum number of records to be returned from the index,  and then fetched from the heap \ payload key value pair. In the case of both Redis and Postgres Database the limit is pushed down and limited in the server to to avoid redundant data coming across the wire.  Fetch limits to not have any effect on the deletion of data which will defer to the reference date to determine deletion. | 100                                  |
| Cache TTL Interval                         | For the calculation of offsetting the current reference date for creation of a deletion threshold, the interval to be used in the calculation of the threshold.

The incorrect configuration of Response Elevation and Limits is one of the more common reasons why Response Elevations
may be zero, even though they are set to a value in an Activation Rule.

Placing each one of the example values into their respective fields in the Model page as follows:

![Image.png](DefaultValuesInModel.png)

Click the Add button to commit the new Model specification:

![Image](DefaultValuesInModelAddButton.png)

Confirmation that the Entity Model has been created will return in the form of a GUID having being created:

![Image](ConfirmationModelSaved.png)

The GUID will be 81abd51c-0013-41c1-a4c7-4a6270eb5aa4. It follows that the HTTP endpoint will
be https://localhost:5001/api/invoke/EntityAnalysisModel/81abd51c-0013-41c1-a4c7-4a6270eb5aa4.

In the case of AMQP integration, a header key value pair of EntityAnalysisModelGuid =
81abd51c-0013-41c1-a4c7-4a6270eb5aa4 will be used.

For the newly created Guid (keeping in mind that in most documented example the default guid of
90c425fd-101a-420b-91d1-cb7a24a969cc will be used), perform a POST of the example JSON
to https://localhost:5001/api/invoke/EntityAnalysisModel/81abd51c-0013-41c1-a4c7-4a6270eb5aa4:

![Image](NewGUIDInHTTPPost.png)

Without synchronisation, the endpoint would return HTTP status Not Found (404).

Navigate to Models >> Synchronisation:

![Image](SynchronisationPage.png)

The synchronisation page shows the instances running and their status, be that when last heartbeat or last model
synchronisation took place.

Click "Synchronise Now":

![Image](SynchroniseNowButton.png)

The nodes running the engine will turn an orange colour indicating that the synchronisation is pending:

![Image](PendingSynchronisation.png)

Turning green upon the Synchronisation having been completed (refreshing every 30 seconds, unless otherwise instructed
by clicking the Refresh button):

![Image](SynchronisedAndRefreshButton.png)

Upon synchronisation, proceed to POST the JSON to the
endpoint [https://localhost:5001/api/invoke/EntityAnalysisModel/81abd51c-0013-41c1-a4c7-4a6270eb5aa4](https://localhost:5001/api/invoke/EntityAnalysisModel/81abd51c-0013-41c1-a4c7-4a6270eb5aa4)
and observe response:

![Image](HTTPResponse.png)

It can be observed that the HTTP response status is of 200, which means that there was no error in processing:

![Image](StatusCode200InResponse.png)

In the event that there is an error in processing it will be communicated by HTTP status code:

* Bad Request (400) in the event that a head check fails for the JSON, the JSON does not parse, is of invalid length or
  is subject other constraints.
* Not Ready (204) in the event the engine is not ready to respond to requests from the model, which may happen when an
  instance is starting.
* Not Found (404) in the event a bad Guid has been provided or the Guid cannot be matched to a synchronised model.
* Internal Error (500) in the event of other unspecified processing error available to the logs.

During model invocation Asynchronous methods are used quite extensively to avoid blocking IO operations, with the
following flow and asynchronous method use:

Note that the invocation flow is written in a manner that achieves a large degree of parallelism in processing, which
greatly improves the transaction response times, with the trade off being much more load being placed on the Thread
Pool. Put differently, response times come at a cost of greater thread and compute requirements. In invocation the
request is responded upon a the point att writes have taken place (this is to say that on response the transaction has
been concluded durably). During invocation writes are performed asynchronously and at the earliest possible opportunity,
however in some cases (such as TTL Counter writes upon Activation) can only happen later in the process, and in the case
where model strategy relies upon TTL Counters, the user of Redis cache instead of PostgresSQL may be more appropriate.
