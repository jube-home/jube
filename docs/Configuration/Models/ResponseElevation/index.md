# Activation Rules with Response Elevation
Response elevation - commonly inferred as a decline code - is a consequence of the activation rule match.  The Response Elevation has several other properties which can direct action, with the values being returned in the response payload also.

Navigate to the Activation Rule that was created beforehand,  titled Volume1DayUSDForIPOver100,  clicking on it for the purposes of editing:

Synchronise the model via Entity >> Synchronisation and repeat the HTTP POST to endpoint [https://localhost:5001/api/invoke/EntityAnalysisModel/90c425fd-101a-420b-91d1-cb7a24a969cc](https://localhost:5001/api/invoke/EntityAnalysisModel/90c425fd-101a-420b-91d1-cb7a24a969cc) for response as follows:

It can be seen from the HTTP response payload that the Response Elevation has been returned as 9, alongside the URL and example messages configured. It is worth noting that if more than one Activation Rule seeks to allocate a Response Elevation,  it can only be to a value greater than the one already existing (hence the name Response Elevation).
